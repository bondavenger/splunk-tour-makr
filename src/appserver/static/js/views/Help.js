                <div class="answer">
                    The image based tour is a slideshow of images and captions. With left/right navigation, the user can navigate through the tour at his/her leisure and exit at any time.
                    <p>
                        <ul><b>NOTES:</b>
                            <li> The suggested image size is 960px X 716px but a higher quality image is fine b/c it will be fit into the window. </li>
                            <li> Captions can contain HTML. </li>
                        <ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">What are interactive tours?</div>
                <div class="answer">The interactive tour is a step-by-step tour that highlights parts of the DOM and gives a caption for each step. Like the image tour, it's self guided.
                    <p>
                        <ul><b>NOTES:</b>
                            <li> This tour assumes you will provide DOM selectors (class names or ids). If none is provided or it doesn't exist on the page, the step will be centered. </li>
                            <li> Captions can contain HTML. </li>
                            <li> These tours are page specific. Having a step by step tour make for one page won't work right running the same tour on another page.</li>
                            <li> <a href="#" class="advanced-options">Advanced options</a>
                                <div class="advanced-options-container">
                                    <b>Used if user wants a click event to occur (to reveal a dropdown or reveal a tab pane for instance</b>
                                    <pre> stepClickEvent[integer] = [mousedown || mouseup || click]\r stepClickElement[integer] = [selector to be "clicked"]</pre>
                                </div>

                </div>

                <div class="question">How do I edit the tour(s) directly via conf file?</div>
                <div class="answer">Tours are stored in a conf file: etc/system/default/ui-tour.conf. Any updates directly to the the tours should be done via etc/system/local/ui-tour.conf. As for the tours created via this app, they are stored in the apps directory: etc/apps/tour_makr/local/ui-tour.conf.</div>

                <div class="question">Where are the images stored?</div>
                <div class="answer">For the tours created via this app, the images are stored in the apps static directory:  etc/apps/tour_makr/appserver/static/img/[tourname]</div>

                <div class="question">How do I make a tour launch?</div>
                <div class="answer">Tours are launched by appending the tour id to the querystring of any url in Splunk. For example, to launch a specific tour on the Reports page, append the querystring: "tour=tour-name". This will launch a tour with the id of "tour-name".</div>

                <div class="question">How do I make a tour auto popup for users?</div>
                <div class="answer">I can make a tour auto prompt on a page?! But, of course! To do so, all you need to do is name the tour (set the tour id) to the name of the view you\'re going to use it on and append "-tour" to it. For example:
                    <p>If you want to auto prompt for a tour on the Reports page, the tour stanza name would need to be [reports-tour].</p>
                    <ul><b>NOTES:</b>
                        <li> Once a tour has been skipped or viewed by a user, an attribute is set on that tour as viewed. It will no longer prompt a user after.</li>
                        <li> Prompts are per user. </li>
                        <li> To override the viewed state and continually make a prompt occur, simply add "viewed = 0" to your tour. </li>
                    <ul>
                </div>
            `;
        }
    }
});
