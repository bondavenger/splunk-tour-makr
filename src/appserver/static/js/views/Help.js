                <div class="answer">
                    The image based tour is a slideshow of images and captions. With left/right navigation, the user can navigate through the tour at his/her leisure and exit at any time.
                    <p>
                        <ul><b>NOTES:</b>
                            <li> The suggested image size is 960px X 716px but a higher quality image is fine b/c it will be fit into the window. </li>
                            <li> Captions can contain HTML. </li>
                        <ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">What are interactive tours?</div>
                <div class="answer">The interactive tour is a step-by-step tour that highlights parts of the DOM and gives a caption for each step. Like the image tour, it's self guided.
                    <p>
                        <ul><b>NOTES:</b>
                            <li> This tour assumes you will provide DOM selectors (class names or ids). If none is provided or it doesn't exist on the page, the step will be centered. </li>
                            <li> Captions can contain HTML. </li>
                            <li> These tours are page specific. Having a step by step tour make for one page won't work right running the same tour on another page.</li>
                            <li> <a href="#" class="advanced-options">Advanced options</a>
                                <div class="advanced-options-container">
                                    <b>Used if user wants a click event to occur (to reveal a dropdown or reveal a tab pane for instance</b>
                                    <pre> stepClickEvent[integer] = [mousedown || mouseup || click]\r stepClickElement[integer] = [selector to be "clicked"]</pre>

                <div class="question">How do I edit the tour(s) directly via conf file?</div>
                <div class="answer">Tours are stored in a conf file: etc/system/default/ui-tour.conf. Any updates directly to the the tours should be done via etc/system/local/ui-tour.conf. As for the tours created via this app, they are stored in the apps directory: etc/apps/tour_makr/local/ui-tour.conf.</div>

                <div class="question">Where are the images stored?</div>
                <div class="answer">For the tours created via this app, the images are stored in the apps static directory:  etc/apps/tour_makr/appserver/static/img/[tourname]</div>

                <div class="question">How do I launch a tour?</div>
                <div class="answer">Tours are launched by appending the tour id to the querystring of any url in Splunk. For example:
                    To launch a tour named <b>tour-foo</b> on the Reports page, use <b>/app/search/reports?tour=tour-foo</b>.
                </div>

                <div class="question">How do I make a tour auto popup for users?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>I can make a tour auto prompt on a page?! But, of course! Here are the steps to do so: (this will involve editing the etc/apps/tour_makr/local/ui-tour.conf file)</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Name the tour (set the tour id) to the name of the view you\'re going to use it.</li>
                        <li>Append "-tour" to that name. For example:
                            <p>If you want to auto prompt for a tour on the Reports page, the tour stanza name would need to be <b>[reports-tour]</b>.</p></li>
                        <li>Here's the tricky part... We allow users to create tours for enterprise and light instances, so you have to add this info to the tour name. Here's how it looks using the above example:
                            <p> Use <b>[reports-tour:enterprise]</b> for Enterprise and <b>[reports-tour:lite]</b> for Splunk Light instances.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul><b>NOTES:</b>
                        <li> Once a tour has been skipped or viewed by a user, an attribute is set on that tour as viewed. It will no longer prompt a user after.</li>
                        <li> Prompts are per user. </li>
                        <li> To override the viewed state and continually make a prompt occur, simply add "viewed = 0" to your tour. </li>
                    <ul>
                </div>
            `;
        }
    }
});
